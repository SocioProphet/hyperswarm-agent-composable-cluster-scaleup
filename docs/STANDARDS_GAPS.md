# Standards Gaps

This file tracks gaps against the SocioProphet storage standards that could not be fully
verified or remediated in the current change set.

## Open Issues
1. **Standards source unavailable in this environment**
   - **Gap:** The storage standards repository could not be fetched due to network restrictions
     (GitHub 403), so the authoritative checklist could not be verified line-by-line.
   - **Impact:** Documentation completeness is based on best-effort interpretation of expected
     storage standards sections.
   - **Remediation:** Re-run documentation review with direct access to
     `https://github.com/SocioProphet/socioprophet-standards-storage` and map each requirement to
     this repository's artifacts.

2. **Explicit standards mapping table**
   - **Gap:** A formal crosswalk table from storage standard requirements to repository files is
     not included because the canonical requirement list was unavailable.
   - **Impact:** Auditors must infer alignment from the narrative specification.
   - **Remediation:** Add a standards crosswalk section once the standards checklist is available.
